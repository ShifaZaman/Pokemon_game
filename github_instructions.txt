First time setting up github on mac? do this (https://github.com/login?return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsettings%2Ftokens) AND then do ⁠ git init ⁠, ⁠ git add . ⁠, ⁠ git commit -m "first commit" ⁠, ⁠ git push ⁠, then login/

[1] ⁠ git clone <HTTPS> ⁠
[2] ⁠ git add . ⁠ OR ⁠ git add file.py ⁠
[3] ⁠ git status ⁠ tells you what has been detected as changed that you wish to add, aka, what the computer has picked up.
[4] ⁠ git commit -m "MESSAGE" ⁠ tells you what you wish to save as this for Github to recognize if you wish to revert back in future.
[5] ⁠ git push ⁠ pushes your changes that you added in step 2 into production Github page.
[6] ⁠ git checkout <commit#> ⁠ this helps you move back and forth between the different versions

Github Headless Issue:

1.⁠ ⁠To change versions, use 'git checkout <COMMIT#>'
2.⁠ ⁠To see which version you are on (or branches), type 'git branch -v'. The green text means what you are on.
NOTE: when you change commits, the HEAD of GitHub gets detached (https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/git-checkout-commits)
3.⁠ ⁠Once you want to move back to the original code at the top without any changes, then do ⁠ 'git checkout main' ⁠

HOWEVER, if you NEED to make a change to an older version that needs to replace the Main branch code (including all changes in the main branch on GitHub), then do:
⁠ git branch tmp ⁠ : (THIS creating a new branch called tmp)
⁠ git checkout main ⁠ (Move back to MAIN latest changes on GitHub)
⁠ git merge tmp ⁠ (Merge the tmp changes back onto GITHUB)
⁠ git branch -D tmp ⁠ (Delete tmp changes)


IF all else fails, delete the repository folder and do ⁠ git clone <HTTPS> ⁠
